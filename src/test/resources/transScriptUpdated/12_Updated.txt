Let's seeArchitecture Dashboard in action!If this is your first timeusing Architecture Dashboard,you'll need to set it up. Log in and follow theinstructions on the Screen. In our case, thesetup is already completed. After login, Architecture Dashboard'sinitial Screen shows a view of all appsthat are present in your environment. Each app has a color thatrepresents its agility score. The agility score has five levels. From red. . . . . . to green. Red indicates low agility,while green indicates higher agility. Lower agility means thatthe app is manifesting ahigher number of or more severe issues. Issues can be related withperformance, security, architecture,or maintainability. For each pattern, you can checkwhere the finding actually occurs. In this case, it is in aSQL query named CheckUsageApps. The SQL query is actually definedinside the VMF_ConfigurationCore Module. Note that Architecture Dashboarddoes not fix the findings automatically;that is up to the developers. Another useful feature inArchitecture Dashboard is thatit opens directly in Service Studio. Let's select another app. Instead of opening the appreport, let's open this app's modules. Here, we can see the app's modules,along with its agility score color code. We can now open themodule report and seethe findings for this particular module. This result is similar towhat we saw earlier for apps. Thank you for watching this quickwalkthrough of Architecture Dashboard. Keep increasing your agility score!
