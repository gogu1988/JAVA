Hi there, and welcome to the MobileApplication Architecture course overview. Mobile devices have a number ofdifferent characteristics that we needto take into account when designing thearchitecture for those applicationsthings like the size of the screen tobeing able to store files locally on thedevice and use some of the nativefeatures of the device like GPS locationand the camera all can affect thearchitecture of the applications that wewould like to build so in this course wehave two different sections one thatfocuses on local storage andsynchronization and another that focuseson the plugins UI and security in thefirst section of the course we talkedabout how to use local storage to storethings on the device and limit thenumber of server-side calls that need tobe madewe also discussed synchronizationfactors when calling to the server andsynchronizing the data things likefrequency the size of the data thegranularity and types of transactionsthat need to occur all can affect howthat should happen so we discuss all ofthose in the first section in the secondsection of the course we discuss pluginsUI and security plugins that will helpus access the native features of thedevice can be very important andunderstanding how we can create thoseand then interact with the nativefeatures is very important we'll alsotalk about the UI approach for definingthe look and feel and the themes ofthings inside of mobile devices and howCSS can affect that and we'll also talkabout security because the mobile deviceis separate making sure security for theapplications on those devices is verysecure is important so we need tounderstand more about authenticationencryption and SSL pinning which is aparticular way to prevent certain typesof attacks all of those can be veryimportant so we'll cover those inside ofthe sitesection so a lot of interesting andimportant things to cover in the twosections for this course so that's itfor the course overview let's go aheadand get started
