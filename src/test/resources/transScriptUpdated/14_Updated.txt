Hi there, and welcome to the ArchitecturePatterns in OutSystems course overview. The topic of architectural patterns is anatural follow-on once we understand thebasics of architecture and how to designapplications looking for reusablepatterns and things that will be bestpractices makes a lot of sense so thiscourse will focus on that there are twosections to this course one section thatfocuses on the library module patternsand another section that focuses on coremodule patterns and you can see by thetwo sections that we look at thepatterns according to the layer of thefour layer canvas that those patternsmight fall into so on the lowest levelat the library module pattern layer wewould look at the extension pattern andthe connector pattern and for theconnector pattern it's very importantsometimes to make sure that the AP isthat we're using have the correctgranularity so we'll look at all ofthose topics regarding the librarymodule layer and then we'll move on tothe core module layer and the patternsthat we might find there so the mostcommon pattern is the core entitypattern which would make sense given thelayer that we're in and then if thosecore entities are actually being servedfrom external systems we end up withwhat we call the external core servicepattern and there's a base pattern forthat and several different variations sowe'll discuss all of those and thenthere's also a transparency servicepattern that is very common in the coremodule layer we talked about the librarymodules first because they're sort ofthe base and they're the things thatwill connect us to the external systemsand we talked about the core modulepattern second because in something likethe external core service pattern weactually use connectors and other typesof things at different times so some ofthe core module patterns are actuallyaggregates of different types ofpatternsso these can be a little bit morecomplex and involved but we'll reviewboth sets of patterns in two differentsections and at the end of that weshould understand some of the bestpatterns that are available for us tocreate highly reusable services andthat's it for this course overview solet's go ahead and get started
