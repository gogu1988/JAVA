We already have ServiceStudio opened, where we'll seethe Style Guide architecture in action. To start, we willcreate a new application. We'll start from scratch. In this demo, we'lluse the Reactive Web App. We have to define thebasic information about our app. Now that we have our appcreated, we'll create the first Module. This Module will be based onthe Reactive Web App template. The first Module createdshould be the Theme Module. The Module will be aclone of the template,and hence have thetheme defined inside of it. If we look into the theme created. . . We can see in its properties thatit's based on the OutSystems UI theme. We won't change the theme inthis demo, but we'll create anotherModule after publishing this one. Back to the Directory application tab. . . We'll now create thesecond Module inside this app. This is an end-user Module,where Screens should be defined. If we look at the themes, we cansee that we now have a referenceto the theme from the first Module. Now, let's create aScreen just to test the app. Pick a Screen template and set its name. To handle the errors andensure a good user experience, weshould add a Global Exception Handler. It will be simple,just to clear the warnings. Let's just add somecontent to our Screen. And finally, publish it. There we have it. The Screen based on the themedefined in the Directory_Th Module,which in turn is based on OutSystems UI.
