We already have Service
Studio opened, where we'll seethe Style Guide architecture in action.To start, we will
create a new application.We'll start from scratch.In this demo, we'll
use the Reactive Web App.We have to define the
basic information about our app.Now that we have our app
created, we'll create the first Module.This Module will be based on
the Reactive Web App template.The first Module created
should be the Theme Module.The Module will be a
clone of the template,and hence have the
theme defined inside of it.If we look into the theme created...We can see in its properties that
it's based on the OutSystems UI theme.We won't change the theme in
this demo, but we'll create anotherModule after publishing this one.Back to the Directory application tab...We'll now create the
second Module inside this app.This is an end-user Module,
where Screens should be defined.If we look at the themes, we can
see that we now have a referenceto the theme from the first Module.Now, let's create a
Screen just to test the app.Pick a Screen template and set its name.To handle the errors and
ensure a good user experience, weshould add a Global Exception Handler.It will be simple,
just to clear the warnings.Let's just add some
content to our Screen.And finally, publish it.There we have it.The Screen based on the theme
defined in the Directory_Th Module,which in turn is based on OutSystems UI.
