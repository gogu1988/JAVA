Let's see
Architecture Dashboard in action!If this is your first time
using Architecture Dashboard,you'll need to set it up.Log in and follow the
instructions on the Screen.In our case, the
setup is already completed.After login, Architecture Dashboard's
initial Screen shows a view of all appsthat are present in your environment.Each app has a color that
represents its agility score.The agility score has five levels.From red......to green.Red indicates low agility,
while green indicates higher agility.Lower agility means that
the app is manifesting ahigher number of or more severe issues.Issues can be related with
performance, security, architecture,or maintainability.For each pattern, you can check
where the finding actually occurs.In this case, it is in a
SQL query named CheckUsageApps.The SQL query is actually defined
inside the VMF_ConfigurationCore Module.Note that Architecture Dashboard
does not fix the findings automatically;that is up to the developers.Another useful feature in
Architecture Dashboard is thatit opens directly in Service Studio.Let's select another app.Instead of opening the app
report, let's open this app's modules.Here, we can see the app's modules,
along with its agility score color code.We can now open the
module report and seethe findings for this particular module.This result is similar to
what we saw earlier for apps.Thank you for watching this quick
walkthrough of Architecture Dashboard.Keep increasing your agility score!
