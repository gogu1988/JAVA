Welcome to this
demo, where we'll see theDiscovery architecture tool in action.We already have a series
of apps in our environment.Let's start by
installing Discovery from Forge.Search for the Discovery component...and install it!Wait for the installation to finish.Now, let's open
Discovery and do a walkthrough.Discovery's initial
screen provides an overview ofall apps and modules in the environment.At first, you might not see any
data. Wait a bit and refresh whileDiscovery does the initial loading.After that, we can now see
the total number of apps...and the number of modules.Below, we also have
the findings that havebeen detected for both apps and modules.We have findings for apps...and also for modules.We'll see these in more detail next.If we navigate to the Module Canvas...we can see all the modules.Modules were automatically
categorized into a specificlayer based on naming conventions.In each module, you can see the
number of consumer modules and producers.Clicking on each arrow reveals the
list of elements that are referenced.When a finding exists, you
will see an indication of that,as it happens in this case.Clicking it reveals which
elements are causing the finding.All of this information will
help you understand the overallarchitecture of your apps and modules.As mentioned before, the
modules were categorized automatically,but how?The way modules are
categorized can be configured.In this screen, you
can customize the existingnaming conventions or add your own.If you change the
configuration, you canrun the auto classification for modules.Just click the 'Auto Classify' button.You can also fine tune the
classification on your own.On each module, you can
change the layer defined.The architecture
will be revalidated basedon the rules of the Architecture Canvas.If we move to the apps view...Here, the view is similar to
the one we saw for modules before,although here we see apps.Another important feature of
Discovery is that it works based on snapshots.Therefore, if you need
to refresh the analysis,simply capture a new
snapshot of the environment.That's it!Explore Discovery and keep the
number of findings close to zero.See you at the next lesson.
