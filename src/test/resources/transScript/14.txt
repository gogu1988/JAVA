Hi there, and welcome to the Architecture
Patterns in OutSystems course overview.The topic of architectural patterns is a
natural follow-on once we understand thebasics of architecture and how to design
applications looking for reusablepatterns and things that will be best
practices makes a lot of sense so thiscourse will focus on that there are two
sections to this course one section thatfocuses on the library module patterns
and another section that focuses on coremodule patterns and you can see by the
two sections that we look at thepatterns according to the layer of the
four layer canvas that those patternsmight fall into so on the lowest level
at the library module pattern layer wewould look at the extension pattern and
the connector pattern and for theconnector pattern it's very important
sometimes to make sure that the AP isthat we're using have the correct
granularity so we'll look at all ofthose topics regarding the library
module layer and then we'll move on tothe core module layer and the patterns
that we might find there so the mostcommon pattern is the core entity
pattern which would make sense given thelayer that we're in and then if those
core entities are actually being servedfrom external systems we end up with
what we call the external core servicepattern and there's a base pattern for
that and several different variations sowe'll discuss all of those and then
there's also a transparency servicepattern that is very common in the core
module layer we talked about the librarymodules first because they're sort of
the base and they're the things thatwill connect us to the external systems
and we talked about the core modulepattern second because in something like
the external core service pattern weactually use connectors and other types
of things at different times so some ofthe core module patterns are actually
aggregates of different types ofpatterns
so these can be a little bit morecomplex and involved but we'll review
both sets of patterns in two differentsections and at the end of that we
should understand some of the bestpatterns that are available for us to
create highly reusable services andthat's it for this course overview so
let's go ahead and get started
