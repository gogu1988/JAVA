Welcome!In this lesson, we will
explain why it is important todesign a good application architecture.To get there, we will talk about
what building quality software means andexplore the typical issues that surface
when architectural concerns are lacking.Why is application
architecture important whenbuilding quality software solutions?If we go back to
1991, the InternationalStandards Organization
(ISO), and the InternationalElectrotechnical Commission
(IEC), put together a standardon the quality of software solutions.This standard included
several different dimensions.Usability from the
point of view of the users.Functionality as a set of
functions that satisfy needs.Efficiency, which
relates the performanceto the amount of resources used.Maintainability, which relates to
the effort needed to make modifications.Portability, which defines the ability
to move software between environments.And Reliability, which ensures
that a software solution can maintainits performance over a period of time.Later on, in 2011,
the standard was updated.Security was added to
ensure that software solutionscan protect information and data.Compatibility was also added as a
way to ensure that a piece of softwarecan work together with other systems.Building quality
software is important, and allof these dimensions are quite relevant.Having a well-defined
software architecture allows you tothink ahead in all of these dimensions.So what are some of the
typical issues that arisedue to a lack of architectural concerns?When services for
core business concepts arenot correctly isolated and
abstracted, less code reuse exists,and business rules tend to
be spread all over the place.Dependencies between
systems that are notcorrectly isolated become unmanageable.Updating or replacing a system has a
snowball effect on the remaining parts.When we change one thing in
the code, another part breaks.Legacy systems tend to
take longer to change and adaptto the different needs and requirements.Sometimes the technology is
obsolete, and the core information accumulatedcan obstruct its replacement.Without a good plan and
well-defined application architecture,you can end up with what we
might call a "Spaghetti Architecture."Such systems can hinder future
changes as they become less flexibleand much more difficult to manage.One small change in one component ...often creates a
series of complex, cascadingeffects on the other components.Sometimes this is also known as
'tightly coupled architecture,'or 'brittle architecture.'So, why is architecture important?If you spend time thinking
about and discussing architecture,it will increase awareness and
understanding of the solution.It also helps create
common ground among allthe people and teams that are involved.The project complexity
becomes more evident asthe different systems get represented.An appropriate level of
abstraction in modelinghelps to reduce the emerging
complexity by focusing on the relevant propertiesand omitting irrelevant detail, thus
leading to a simpler representation.By managing the complexity, you
may actually reduce the overall risk.We need to evaluate a
system's architecture for its capacityto support the quality attributes
that meet the organization's goals.Architecture evaluation is a
cost-effective way of mitigatingsubstantial risks and ensuring success.Thinking about the complexity and the
risks will help you support planning.This way, you will do a better job
anticipating and building solutionsthat will be better understood.As you are going
through the building process,it can also facilitate change.When something comes
up that requires you toveer from the original design or path,
the architecture of your system can showyou exactly what needs to change and
help with communication and planning.Finally, all these
benefits can help youreduce the overall cost of your project.As you can see, spending
time thinking about architecturecan provide a lot of different benefits.These benefits are not only
technical, they also affect how you operate,and the overall
visibility of how you build things.In the next lesson,
we will introduce youto the OutSystems Architecture Canvas.
