Hi there, and welcome to the Mobile
Application Architecture course overview.Mobile devices have a number of
different characteristics that we needto take into account when designing the
architecture for those applicationsthings like the size of the screen to
being able to store files locally on thedevice and use some of the native
features of the device like GPS locationand the camera all can affect the
architecture of the applications that wewould like to build so in this course we
have two different sections one thatfocuses on local storage and
synchronization and another that focuseson the plugins UI and security in the
first section of the course we talkedabout how to use local storage to store
things on the device and limit thenumber of server-side calls that need to
be madewe also discussed synchronization
factors when calling to the server andsynchronizing the data things like
frequency the size of the data thegranularity and types of transactions
that need to occur all can affect howthat should happen so we discuss all of
those in the first section in the secondsection of the course we discuss plugins
UI and security plugins that will helpus access the native features of the
device can be very important andunderstanding how we can create those
and then interact with the nativefeatures is very important we'll also
talk about the UI approach for definingthe look and feel and the themes of
things inside of mobile devices and howCSS can affect that and we'll also talk
about security because the mobile deviceis separate making sure security for the
applications on those devices is verysecure is important so we need to
understand more about authenticationencryption and SSL pinning which is a
particular way to prevent certain typesof attacks all of those can be very
important so we'll cover those inside ofthe site
section so a lot of interesting andimportant things to cover in the two
sections for this course so that's itfor the course overview let's go ahead
and get started
