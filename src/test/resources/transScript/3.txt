In this lesson, you will be
introduced to the architecture design process.This three-step process will help you
design your application architecture.It is fundamental to align your
architecture with your business goals.Business must orient architecture,
so business needs and concepts shouldbe properly translated into Modules.This strategy allows the Modules
to evolve and scale with business,while ensuring independent
lifecycles between different lines of business.The three steps for
architecture design are Disclose,Organize, and Assemble.The first step is
where business concepts,integration needs, and non-functionalrequirements are disclosed.Identifying relevant user
stories can achieve this disclosure.Understanding who will
interact or access the application,what the roles are,
and the kind of differentactions each person can perform are
also important questions to answer.Analyzing existing
documentation, or simply by having aconversation with business
stakeholders will also add valuable context.The information architecture as
recognized by the business users.Either talking with the
users or analyzing an existingsystem that you are going to augment
or replace will help you get a clearview of the information architecture.We need to understand
the integration technologythat will be involved in the project.So it's important to disclose
what information will be consumedfrom external sources or systems.It is also important to
disclose the needed integrations.The type of API,
communication protocol,I/O structure, message headers,and others.User experience is another key factor.Will accessibility be a requirement?What types of channels are planned?Is this a mobile-only
app, or also a web app?Different roles might use
or require different channels,which results in a
different user experience.It is important to disclose as many
concepts from the beginning as possible.As the project moves
forward, you might end up disclosingmore concepts and finding more details.Missing major concepts at
the beginning might compromisethe future of your applications,
leading to complex refactoring later on.From the Disclose
step, we move to Organize.Here, concepts will be added to
the layers of the Architecture Canvas.As you start
organizing concepts, you canactually disclose some more concepts.In the end, both
Disclose and Organize work intandem and require a bit of iteration.Interface-related concepts and
processes are placed at the end-user layer.Core business concepts
end up in the core layer.While integration needs and
non-functional requirements shouldbe placed in the foundation layer.Keep in mind that during the
Disclose and Organize steps,we are still talking about concepts,
not Modules nor application artifacts.The third and final step is where
concepts are assembled into Modules.In this step, you should
follow a few principles.The concepts that relate
to others should be joined.For instance, if theconcepts Customer and
Claim are related, theyshould be joined into the same Module.However, concepts
with different lifecyclesshould be split into different
Modules, even if they are related.For example, the Customer and
Contract concepts can be related,but if you realize that some of
the customers don't have a contract,it means they have different
lifecycles and therefore shouldn't be joined.The third principle says to isolate
reusable logic from integration logic.Reusable logic should be
isolated in the core layer,while integration logic
ends up in the foundation layer.This protects the reusable core logic
from external system changes by keepingthem independent from each other.Finally, when
possible, you should applyknown architectural design patterns.In the beginning, this
may not be 100% clear,but as you move on you'll get
to know more patterns and definea better and more robust architecture.Once you complete the process, you
end up with an "architecture blueprint."The blueprint shows each
Module in the corresponding layer.From there, you should now add
the dependencies between Modules.Doing so gives you an
initial idea of what they need andhow each Module relates to the others.During the project,
you need to keep iteratingthe three steps of the process.As you disclose new
concepts, you need to organizethem and assemble them into the canvas.In the next lesson, we'll
put this process into practice.
